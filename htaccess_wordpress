Amazing things to do with htaccess in WordPress

The default contents of a .htaccess file in a WordPress website is this:

    # BEGIN WordPress
    <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteBase /
    RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [L]
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
    RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
    </IfModule>
    # END WordPress

**Redirecting Between ‘www’ and ‘non-www’**

\- redirect the www domain to the naked domain

    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\.mycompanyname\.com [NC]
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://mycompanyname.com/$1 [L,R=301]

\- redirect from a ‘non-www’ domain to ‘www’

    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^mycompanyname.com [NC]
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.mycompanyname.com/$1 [R=301,L]

**301 Redirect (permanent redirect)**

permanently replace a URL with another

    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^mycompanyname.com [NC,OR]
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www.mycompanyname.com [NC]
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://example.com/$1 [L,R=301,NC]

**302 Redirect (temporary redirect)**

This redirect is used when a content is temporarily moved to another location

    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^mycompanyname.com [NC,OR]
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www.mycompanyname.com [NC]
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://example.com/$1 [L,R=301,NC]

**Force to HTTPS**

    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
    RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]

**Block IP Addresses**

    Deny from 94.66.58.135

**Prevent Image Hotlinking**

Image hotlinking is where someone embeds an image on your website into their own. This can be problematic as it means your server is having to potentially work overtime to serve up image(s) on someone else’s website.

    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^$
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http(s)?://(www\.)?mycompanyname.com [NC]
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http(s)?://(www\.)?google.com [NC]
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http(s)?://(www\.)?yahoo.com [NC]
    RewriteRule \.(jpg|jpeg|png|gif)$ - [F]

**Disable XML-RPC Access**

    # Block WordPress xmlrpc.php requests
    <Files xmlrpc.php>
